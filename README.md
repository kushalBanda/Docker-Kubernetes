## Microservices Architecture
A Variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style arranges an application as a collection of loosely couped services. 

In a microservices architecture, service-oriented services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

## Monolithic Architecture
* Built as a single unit
* Deployed as a single unit
* Duplicated on each server

## Microservices 
* Segregates functionality into smaller seperate services each with a single reponsibility. 
* Scales out by deploying each service independently.
* Loosely coupled
* Enable autonomous development by different teams, languages and platforms. 
* Can be written by smaller teams. 
* Each microservice can own it's own data/database.

## From Monolith to Microservices
* Break your application/system in small units. 
* Use the strangler pattern.
